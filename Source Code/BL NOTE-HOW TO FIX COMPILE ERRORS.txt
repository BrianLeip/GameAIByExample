Most of these old VS Project files don't work anymore.

The first step is to retarget the project.  Either do it automatically when opening or go to Project --> Retarget solution

But there is also a problem with the include files that won't allow it to build or compile.  
The problem found early on is that he was including some header files that are in a completely different diretory.  
VS don't like that so much, so it needs to be fixed.
Two ways to fix it:
1) Add the "Common" folder to the VC++ include Directories

- Right click on the Project name (2nd row in solution explorer just under solution
- Properties
- Config Properties --> VC++ Directories
- Include Directories --> Click the dropdown arrow --> Edit
- Click the folder "New Line", then the [...] icon
- Find the Common Directory
- Click OK


2) Change any of the files with an #include reference that hits these files so that it used correct folder navigation

FOR EXAMPLE:
#include "misc/ConsoleUtils.h"
needs to be replaced with 
#include "../../Common/misc/ConsoleUtils.h"


ALSO IMPORANT!
WHEN RUNNING THE FILES, DON'T BUILD THEM OR IT WILL JUST CREATE A LOT OF UNNECESSARY FILES AND TAKE UP SPACE
INSTEAD, JUST GO TO DEBUG --> START WITHOUT DEBUGGING (OR CTRL + F5)
